The **NBA Legacy Project** is a website dedicated to exploring the rich history of the NBA, focusing on the evolution of various teams over the years. The site includes pages that provide insights into historical teams, individual franchises, and their legacies in the world of basketball. The purpose of this project is to celebrate the past and present of the NBA, providing fans and enthusiasts with an engaging platform to learn about the teams that shaped the league.

## Technologies Used

This project uses the following technologies:
